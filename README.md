#  Safe Water Access and Child Mortality

**Final Project — TekHer Data Analytics Fellowship**

This project investigates the relationship between access to safe water, sanitation services, and child mortality rates in developing countries. Using real-world data from WHO/UNICEF JMP and World Bank, it highlights regional disparities, reveals data-driven insights, and supports evidence-based policymaking for SDG 6: Clean Water and Sanitation.

##  Project Objective

To analyze and visualize how access to improved water and sanitation impacts child mortality rates globally, with a focus on:

- Identifying regions and income groups most affected
- Measuring progress toward Sustainable Development Goal 6 (SDG 6)
- Exploring the correlation between WASH services and child health outcomes

##  Key Insights

- Countries with limited access to water and sanitation experience significantly higher child mortality rates.
- Sub-Saharan Africa and low-income countries are the most vulnerable.
- Progress toward SDG 6 is uneven, with many countries off track to meet 2030 targets.
- Improved WASH services are strongly associated with reductions in under-five mortality.
